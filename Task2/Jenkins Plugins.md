### Task2:

#### The Nautilus DevOps team has recently setup a Jenkins server, which they want to use for some CI/CD jobs. Before that they want to install some plugins which will be used in most of the jobs. Please find below more details about the task  
  
Click on the Jenkins button on the top bar to access the Jenkins UI. Login using username `admin` and `Adm!n321` password.  
  -  Once logged in, install `Git` and `GitLab` plugins. You might need to restart Jenkins service to  install these plugins, so we recommend clicking on `Restart Jenkins when installation is complete and no jobs are running` on plugin installation/update page i.e `update centre`.
